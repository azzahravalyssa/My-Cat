                <h2>Timmy - The Mischievous Queen</h2>
                <p>Timmy is the eldest of the family, a feisty female with a "mujair" pattern. Her voice sounds like a squeaky balloon, and she loves wandering around like a little rebel. No door can stop her curiosity!</p>
                <h2>Tamtam - The Black Hole</h2>
                <p>Tamtam is the roundest and fluffiest of them all. His favorite hobby? Eating! A big boy with pitch-black fur, he completely disappears when the lights are off. Good luck finding him in the dark!</p>

                <h2>Bobo - The Elegant Lady</h2>
                <p>Bobo is pure elegance. With a perfect "body goals" figure and a stunning cow-like pattern, she moves with grace. She may look fancy, but she’s got a playful side too!</p>

                <h2>Chiro - The Mini Troublemaker</h2>
                <p>Chiro is the youngest and the most chaotic. Just like her mom, Timmy, she’s a little troublemaker. Her gray fur makes her look innocent, but don’t be fooled—she’s always up to something!</p>
